# ADACS SS20B SStevenson COMPAS

## Setup
### To run on your local machine

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install python packges using [python poetry](https://python-poetry.org/):
Run `poetry install --no-dev` for minimum install. This only installs required production packages.
Run `poetry install` to also install development packages such as testing tools.

3. Create a copy from `src/.env.template` and rename it to `src/.env` and ENSURE ALL DB CONNECTION CONFIG OPTIONS ARE COMMENTED OUT/REMOVED (to use the django sqlite db server)

4. [Download](https://redis.io/download) and install Redis
5. In a new terminal, run Redis server `redis-server`
6. In a new terminal, run Celery worker in
    ```
    cd src
    poetry run celery -A compas.celery worker --loglevel=info
    ```
7. In a new terminal `cd src`
8. Initialise the DB with `poetry run python manage.py migrate`
    - Optional: load test data with `poetry run python manage.py loaddata compasweb/fixtures/test_data.json`
9. Start the development server.
  Run `poetry run python manage.py runserver` and open the [development server](http://localhost:8000/).

### To run the application using docker-compose

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a copy from `.env.template` and rename it to `.env`
    - Uncomment the database connection details and modify usernames + passwords as necessary
      ```
      MYSQL_DATABASE=<name of your MySQL DB>
      MYSQL_USER=<username to log in to DB>
      MYSQL_PASSWORD=<password>
      MYSQL_HOST=<MySQL default hostname>
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<root password>
      DB_PORT=<MySQL Server port>
      ```
      (Note: if you modify the port, you'll need to also change it in `docker-compose.yml`).
    - Modify `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` however you prefer
    - Uncomment `CELERY_BROKER_URL` and `CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND`
      ```
      CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://redis:6379
      CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND=redis://redis:6379
      ```
    - Keep everything else as is
3. If you're running it on your local machine, Run `ROOT_SUBDIRECTORY_PATH="" COMPAS_HOST="" docker-compose up --build` and open the [development server](http://localhost:8080).
4. Alternatively, if you're running on a production server
    - Set the value of COMPAS_HOST to your IP address or domain name if you're not running it locally. Ex. `https://compasportal.com/`
    - Optional: You can set the value of `ROOT_SUBDIRECTORY_PATH`. This is the part that appears after your server IP/domain name. Ex. `live/compasweb`

    - Application URL would be `<IP address/Domain><ROOT_SUBDIRECTORY_PATH>`. Ex. `https://compasportal.com/live/compasweb`
